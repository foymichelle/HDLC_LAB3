# HDLC_LAB3

# Test Case

## Initiation of stations
1. Start PrimaryStation (station A)
2. Start SecondaryStation (station B)
3. Start SecondaryStation (station C)

## Communication procedure:
1. B sends Frame 0 to A
2. B sends Frame 0 to C
3. C sends Frame 0 to B
4. B sends Frame 1 to A
5. C sends Frame 0 to A
6. B sends Frame 1 to C
7. C sends Frame 1 to B

## Communication from B to A (Frame 0)
####On station B console:

> Is there any message to send? (y/n)

> y 

> Please enter the destination address using 8-bits binary string (e.g. 00000001):

> 00000000

> Please enter the message to send?

> Frame 0 from B to A

> recv msg -- control 10001000

####Should see on station A console:

> Message received from 00000001: Frame 0 from B to A

> Connection from /127.0.0.1 accepted.

> accepted client

> client address: 00000010

> Sent SNRM to station 2

> Received UA from station 2

> Sent < RR,*,P > to station 1

## Comunication from B to C (Frame 0)
####On station B console:

> recv msg -- control 10001000

> Is there any message to send? (y/n)

> y

> Please enter the destination address using 8-bits binary string (e.g. 00000001):

> 00000010

> Please enter the message to send?

> Frame 0 from B to C

NOTE: Will need to wait until C sends a frame to see message from B on C console.

## Communication from C to B (Frame 0)
####On station C console
> Is there any message to send? (y/n)

> y

> Please enter the destination address using 8-bits binary string (e.g. 00000001):

> 00000001

> Please enter the message to send?

> Frame 0 from C to B

> recv msg -- control 00000000

> Received data: Frame 0 from B to C // Frame sent above from B

####Should see on station B console
> Received data: Frame 0 from B to C

> recv msg -- control 10001000

> Is there any message to send? (y/n)

## Communication from B to A (Frame 1)
#### On station B console

> Is there any message to send? (y/n)

> y

> Please enter the destination address using 8-bits binary string (e.g. 00000001):

> 00000000

> Please enter the message to send?

> Frame 1 from B to A

#### Should see on station A console

> Message received from 00000001: Frame 1 from B to A

> Sent < RR,*,P > to station 2

## Communication from C to A (Frame 0)
#### On station C console
> Is there any message to send? (y/n)

> y

> Please enter the destination address using 8-bits binary string (e.g. 00000001):

> 00000000

> Please enter the message to send?

> Frame 0 from C to A

#### Should see on station A console
> Message received from 00000010: Frame 0 from C to A

> Sent < RR,*,P > to station 1

## Communication from B to C (Frame 1)
#### On station B console
> Is there any message to send? (y/n)

> y

> Please enter the destination address using 8-bits binary string (e.g. 00000001):

> 00000010

> Please enter the message to send?

> Frame 1 from B to C
